Phase 1.2 IO Placement/ Clock Placement/ Build Placer Device
WARNING: [Place 30-87] Partially locked IO Bus is found. Following components of the IO Bus btn are not locked:  'btn[1]' 
INFO: [Timing 38-35] Done setting XDC timing constraints.
ERROR: [Place 30-574] Poor placement for routing between an IO pin and BUFG. If this sub optimal condition is acceptable for this design, you may use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint in the .xdc file to demote this message to a WARNING. However, the use of this override is highly discouraged. These examples can be used directly in the .xdc file to override this clock rule.
	< set_property CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE FALSE [get_nets CLK100MHZ_IBUF] >

	Clock Rule: rule_gclkio_bufg
	Status: FAILED
	Rule Description: An IOB driving a BUFG must use a CCIO in the same half side (top/bottom) of chip as the BUFG

	CLK100MHZ_IBUF_inst (IBUF.O) is locked to IPAD_X0Y36
	CLK100MHZ_IBUF_BUFG_inst (BUFG.I) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on BUFGCTRL_X0Y31
Resolution: Poor placement of an IO pin and a BUFG has resulted in the router using a non-dedicated path between the two.  There are several things that could trigger this DRC, each of which can cause unpredictable clock insertion delays that result in poor timing.  This DRC could be caused by any of the following: (a) a clock port was placed on a pin that is not a CCIO-pin (b)the BUFG has not been placed in the same half of the device or SLR as the CCIO-pin (c) a single ended clock has been placed on the N-Side of a differential pair CCIO-pin.
